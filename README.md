fleet-templates
===============

Templates used by [fleet-py](https://github.com/totem/fleet-py) for deployment

The templates are created using [Jinja Templates](http://jinja.pocoo.org/). The template is rendered at runtime using [python fleet deployer](https://github.com/totem/fleet-py/blob/master/fleet/deploy/docker_deployer.py)
