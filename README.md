fleet-templates
===============

Templates used by [fleet-py](https://github.com/totem/fleet-py) for deployment

The templates can also contain varaibles surrounded by {} e.g.: {app_name}. The values of this variables
are substitued at runtime by [python fleet deployer](https://github.com/totem/fleet-py/blob/master/fleet/deploy/docker_deployer.py)
